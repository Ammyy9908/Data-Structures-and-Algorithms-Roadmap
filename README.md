# Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap 

> ok let's face it everyone has an endless fear inside, when it comes to Data structures & Algorithms, these two core aspects which technically they're the first Submarine that it will dive with you into Software engineering world or computer science, and even if we want to fake it, but it just doesn't work without the ability to understand these aspects and use them, which literally means: everyone is able to write code, even complete systems architectures, and code runs anyway,
But the real difference between coders and Engineers is very abstracted, programming is just a small part of being an engineer the hardest of being an engineer,  is the architectures itself, so whether it's an App, Platform, or even O-Systems, which is also meant coders do a very small part of the engineering working process, and also when it comes to the new tech learning processes engineers can move between tech stacks and programming languages so easy, but hi wait a second why! what makes them super powerful people, the real answer which everyone is trying to run away from it is The core Fundamentals of Computer science, the power of knowing what happens behind the scenes, the very compact and controllable space and performance, for example, the right Decisions of choosing the best Data structure to organize and store some specific kind of data, knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each one, e.g. the deep understanding of the differences between **Arrays**, **Lists**, **Multimaps**, **Heap**, **Stack**, **Queue**, **Trees**, **Graphs** and so on and so forth, the ability of separating problems into multiple parts, and writing the best implementation to solve these problems with the respect of the performance and the space etc.. 
Actually the whole thing it's much way simpler than you think, but it's supernatural for our brains to have that kind of fear when they do not know anything about it, which we call it Xenophobia or the Fear of the Unknown, so i do know that there is no better time to start, the tech industry expanding horribly, and market needs not just coders but real Engineers

> **Note** by engineers I don't mean the creatures who have CS degrees ü§ì cause most of the CS graduated people they do know these things just as a theoretical views

> wish you all the best and I can't wait to see the transformation you'll go through

## But what is it?

The main purpose of this roadmap is to make you understand almost everything about these two huge main aspects and how to use them in your new coming Apps, or just to crack the company's interview that  you're about to apply to, or finally to simply break this fear wall üí™üèΩ

## Why it's the perfect time to use it?

## it's not hard, but also not easy

---

## What it will consists of?

---

## Do it with love or don't even begin

if you don't have passion about the thing you're doing then it's very hard to gain any progress, even if it feels uncontrollable cause we all want it to happen fast, but every time you feel that you're away from your goal then remember this base constant universal low, for every goal you want to achieve there are some taxes, so you decide if you want to pay them before or after you achieve your happiness euphoria, it feels sometimes hard an so connected but your passion will make it so exciting all the time, so the result of this pain that you're investing in your self and the gain will be knowledge, dream job, great projects ideas etc.. so focus on your goals, breathe, and do it, now or never.
